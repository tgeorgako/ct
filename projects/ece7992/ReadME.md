 *Ruby* and the gems for *Jekyll*, you can find out how to do that [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

## LaTex - CV

### Locally

Before you start make sure you have *pandoc* [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) and *MikTeX* [here](https://miktex.org/download) installed in your computer.
